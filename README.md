# College-Transit

Lambton College runs a shuttle bus between Toronto and Brampton and Missisauga. There’s only one problem - students never know what time the next bus is.  I solved this problem by creating a web application that shows students when the next shuttle will be arriving.  I used Balsamiq to create a mockup of the app’s screen’s before translating it into code. 

**Technologies:** Balsamiq (wireframing), MySQL, PHP,Spectre (CSS Framework), Twillo, HTML
